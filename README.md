# How to use this README

This file is your team’s **working project document**.

You must keep updating it throughout the 4-week build period.  
By the final review, this README should clearly show:
- your idea,
- your planning,
- your design decisions,
- your technical process,
- your build progress,
- your testing,
- your failures and changes,
- your final outcome.

## Rules
- Fill every section.
- Do not delete headings.
- If something does not apply, write `Not applicable` and explain why.
- Add images, screenshots, sketches, links, and videos wherever useful.
- Update task status and weekly logs regularly.
- Use this file as evidence of process, not only as a final report.

## 1.3 Project Title
`[TT Ball Launcher]`

## 1.4 One-Line Pitch
`[A Arduino-powered rhythmic table tennis ball launcher designed to automate solo training with customizable shot patterns, speed, and frequency.]`

## 1.5 Expanded Project Idea
In 1–2 paragraphs, explain:
- what your project is,
- what kind of playful experience it creates,
- what makes it fun, curious, engaging, strange, satisfying, competitive, or delightful,
- what technologies are involved.

**Response:**  
`This project is an interactive ping pong launcher designed as a playful human–machine game. The system uses a motorized launcher to continuously shoot ping pong balls toward a player, who responds with a racket, creating a rally-like experience. The machine essentially acts as a dynamic training partner, turning a simple mechanical setup into an engaging and exciting interactive system.

The experience is fun and engaging because it blends control and unpredictability — users must constantly react to changing ball speeds and angles. It becomes competitive as players try to sustain longer rallies or handle increasing difficulty levels. The project combines mechanical systems (motors, launcher mechanism), electronics (ESP32, sensors, LEDs), and interaction design to create a satisfying, physical, and playful experience as an interactive game`

# 2. Philosophy Fit

## 2.1 Experience, Not Social Problem
This module does **not** require your project to solve a large social problem.

You are allowed to build:
- toys,
- games,
- interactive objects,
- playful machines,
- kinetic artifacts,
- humorous devices,
- strange but delightful experiences,
- things that are entertaining to use or watch.

## 2.2 What kind of experience are you creating?
Answer the following:
- What is the experience?
- What do you want the player or participant to feel?
- Why would someone want to try it again?

**Response:**  
`What is the experience?
The project creates a playful, physical game where a user plays ping pong against a machine that continuously launches balls. It feels like a hybrid between a game and a training partner, where the user actively responds to rapidly incoming balls. The experience is immediate and intuitive — you step in, pick up a racket, and start playing.

What do you want the player or participant to feel?
I want the user to feel a mix of excitement, challenge, and slight unpredictability. It should feel engaging, slightly chaotic at higher speeds, and satisfying when the user successfully keeps a rally going.

Why would someone want to try it again?
Because the experience changes based on how the user interacts with it — they can try different speeds, angles, and modes, making each round slightly different. The challenge of improving their shots and reaction time or sustaining longer rallies encourages repeat attempts, while the playful nature of competing with a machine makes it fun to come back and try again.`

## 2.3 Design Persona
Complete the sentence below:

> We are designing this project as if we are a small creative studio making a **[toy / game / playable object / interactive experience]** for **[children / teens / adults / classmates / exhibition visitors / mixed audience]**.

**Response:**  
`[ We are designing this project as if we are a small creative studio making a **[game / playable object / interactive experience]** for **[children / teens / adults / classmates / exhibition visitors / mixed audience]`

# 3. Inspiration

## 3.1 References
List what inspired the project.

| Source Type | Title / Link | What Inspired You |
|---|---|---|
| `[Video]` | `[(https://youtu.be/tKqPbJfTlDg?si=A5O6gLvXLh6896KT)]` | `[Showed how a machine can continuously launch balls and create a rally-like experience similar to playing with a real opponent.]` |
| `[Website]` | `[(https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Ping_Pong_Robot_V1_DIY_0c6b7731.html)]` | `[Helped understand how ping pong launchers are built using motors and how angle affects the ball direction.]` |
| `[Website]` | `[Link or title](https://www.instructables.com/Ping-Pong-Ball-Launcher-2/)]` | `[Gave a simple idea of how to build a ball launcher using basic materials and components.]` |

## 3.2 Original Twist
What makes your project original?

**Response:**  
`[What makes this project different is that it treats a simple ping pong launcher as an interactive experience rather than just a machine. The focus is not on building a perfect or accurate robot, but on creating a situation where a person actively engages with it — reacting, adjusting, and trying to keep up.

The machine continuously fires balls, so the experience feels fast, slightly unpredictable, and physically engaging. It becomes less about control and more about reaction, rhythm, and endurance. This makes it feel more like playing against something alive rather than using a device, which encourages people to try again and improve.]`
